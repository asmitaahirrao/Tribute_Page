<h1> Information about Bhagat Singh </h1>
<body>
<p>
He was born on 28th of September, 1907 in Sandhu Jat family in Punjab. He was born in a family of freedom fighters, his father Sardar Kishan Singh & Uncle Sardar Ajit Singh were fully involved in the struggle for the independence of India. Being born & brought up in such an environment always inspired him to uproot the Britishers from India. It was all running in his blood. In support of the Mahatma Gandhi to boycott all government-aided institution, he left his school at an early age of 13.<br>
Later he joined National College of Lahore where he learnt European revolutionary acts which motivated him a lot. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre in 1919, drove him to Amritsar where he kissed the earth sanctified by blood. By 1925 he founded the Naujavan Bharat Sabha for national movements. Later he joined Hindustan Republican Association where he came in contact with other revolutionaries on India. He also began writing revolutionary articles against Britishers.<br>
All his activities attracted the attention of Britishers towards him. They also arrested him in 1927. The turning point of his life was in 1928 when an attack by Britishers caused the death of freedom fighter Lala Lajpat Rai. Bhagat Singh was determined to take revenge for the same by shooting the official, Deputy Inspector General Scott for whom India lost one of its most active freedom fighters. He shot down another official mistaking him as Scott. Then he escaped from Lahore to Kolkata & from there to Agra, where he established a bomb factory.<br>
He & his associates bombed the Central Legislative Assembly in protest against the trade dispute bills. He surrendered, police arrested him for the same & confessed his involvement in the incident. He went on a hunger strike for 116 days in the prison to fight against the inhuman behaviour with his fellow prisoners. Later he was executed on 23rd march 1931 at the age of 23. He was smiling before being hanged at this tender age. He was a freedom fighter who never thought about his own life, who kept on smiling & served the nation till his last breath.<br>
Bhagat Singh was indeed a true patriot, who was an outstanding unmatchable revolutionist from a very young age. He is a person who dreamt of growing guns in the fields in his childhood to fight against the Britishers. He never feared his life & was always ready to do every possible thing for his motherland. His death brought a wave of patriotism in the whole country. He is always considered to be a martyr for the country, a brave son of a mother, India.
